Scenarios:
- Login
  - Sucessful
  - Invalid credentials
- Search for driver
  - valid autocomplete option
  - invalid autocomplete
  - no typed letters
  - with just one letter
- Call to a driver
- Use GPS to localize
- Logout

UX Considerations:
 - Once you are in the driver's profile, the app doesn't give a clear option to come back to the main page.
 - Keyboard don't close after login
 - Keyboard don't close if i click outside of him
 - App don't give any feedback if you try to search anything different than an valid autocomplete match
 - If the driver have a long adress, it appears cut off
 - Iconography is not very good. the adress icon, for example, doesn't induce the user to believe that it's an address info by her side
 - Maps doesn't show any... map. I tryed in my mobile and in the emulator, but dont show any map
 - I didn't understand the meaning of the map. Why the user will want to localize herself in this app?
 - Map don't localize GPS. I didn't saw any localization permission asked
 - Thinking about visual, using a logo in the login screen maybe to set an visual identity
 - It's hard to see the username logged in the drawer menu. White letters in a yellow background doesn't seem to fit.
